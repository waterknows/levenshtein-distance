Fix up test cases - make them more robust

#make file todos
update makefile to run all tests in the test/ folder
update makefile to allow a optional parameter for a release version (exclude -g from the g++ line)

# code related todos
look up virtual destructors, they might have not been done correctly
update the raw pointers to C++ 11 smart pointers
clean up the LevenshteinChecker inheritance diagram. It makes more sense that they should use composition instead
	as the only method thats changing is the levenshteinDistance calculation.
update the threadpool class so that instead of passing a string for constructing the checker,
	pass a pre-configured factory.
create a threadsafe FileReaderStack. Probably only need a lock on getUnparsedString.
