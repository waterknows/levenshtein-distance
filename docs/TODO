look up virtual destructors, they might have not been done correctly

update makefile to run all tests in the test/ folder

update makefile to allow a optional parameter for a release version (exclude -g from the g++ line)

update the raw pointers to C++ 11 smart pointers

add make_dictionary.sh to the make file. (possibly add a clean step to remove the file?)

clean up the LevenshteinChecker inheritance diagram. It makes more sense that they should use composition instead
as the only method thats changing is the levenshteinDistance calculation.

set up jenkins for CI
