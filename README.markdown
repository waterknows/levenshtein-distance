Implementation of various edit distance algorithms to practice c++ and look at
the c++ 11 standard library

For reference check out "Levenshtein distance" on the wikipedia

Run install.sh in the config directory to create a bunch of the files

running 'make' from the shell will create all the binaries and then running
/bin/runner will run the levenstein algorithm

running 'make tester' will currently make all the test binaries - you need 
to run them manually. As part of the to-do this will be changed - 
they will be run automatically at the end.
